# rpos
Raspberry Pi Onvif Server

Node.js based Onvif Soap service. (http://www.onvif.org) 

Initial goal is to provide a Onvif Media service which is compatible with Synology Surveillance Station.
This allows the Pi to be used as a surveillance camera without the need for adding any custom camera files to your Synology NAS.

This version uses a patched version of the "node-soap" v0.80 library (https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap/releases/tag/v0.8.0) located @ https://github.com/BreeeZe/node-soap

# Features:

- Streams H264 video over rtsp
- Camera control (resolution and framerate) through Onvif
- Set other camera options through a web interface.

# How to:

Install the live555 library to stream h264 video over rtsp [ source http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=69224&start=15#p289293 ] :

	*login to your pi via ssh
	cd /home/pi/
	wget http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/live555-latest.tar.gz
	tar xvzf live555-latest.tar.gz
	cd live
	./genMakefiles linux
	make
	#delete sources
	cd ..
	rm live -r -f

Install nodejs on your pi (http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/):

	wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
	sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb

Download rpos release from github to your pi
	
	wget https://github.com/BreeeZe/rpos/releases/download/0.1.0/rpos-0.1.0.zip
	unzip rpos-0.1.0.zip
	cd rpos-0.1.0

Optionaly set the service port or other options in rposConfig.json

Then you start rpos by running "sudo node rpos.js"

# Camera settings
You can set camera settings by browsing to : http://CameraIP:Port/
These settings are then saved in a file called v4l2ctl.json and are persisted on rpos restart.

# Known Issues

# ToDo's
- Add authentication
- Add MJPEG
- Implement more ONVIF calls
- and more...
